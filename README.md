Project Plan:

Pilots with a Private Pilot Licence (PPL) must keep track of each of their flights in a logbook similar to the glider pilot logbook shown in the above image. The goal of this project is to create a digital database version of the logbook to track information about a PPL pilotâ€™s flights. This can serve as a backup in case the actual logbook gets damaged. Some information will be omitted such as launch types, height reached, and Dual/Instructor flight times since launch types and height reached are specific to gliders and PPL pilots are no longer in training (Dual) and are not qualified to instruct (Instructor).

Note: I edited the font and color of the text and navbars in css as well as adding background image
